# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model development and deployment. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier for IRIS Dataset (`DTclassifier.ipynb`)
- **Description**: This project involves building a decision tree classifier to classify the iris flowers into three species based on the famous IRIS dataset.
- **Key Concepts**: Decision Trees, Classification, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation.

### 2. EDA on Retail Store Dataset (`EDA RetailStore`)
- **Description**: This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis on a retail store dataset to uncover insights and patterns.
- **Key Concepts**: Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Data Cleaning, Insight Extraction.

### 3. EDA on Sports Dataset (`EDA-Sports.ipynb`)
- **Description**: In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis on a sports dataset to understand various trends and statistics.
- **Key Concepts**: Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Data Cleaning, Insight Extraction.

### 4. KMeans Visualization (`KMeansVisualization`)
- **Description**: This project involves implementing and visualizing the K-Means clustering algorithm on a dataset.
- **Key Concepts**: Clustering, K-Means Algorithm, Data Visualization, Elbow Method.

### 5. Predict Percentage of Marks of Students (`predict PercentageOfMarks of students`)
- **Description**: In this project, I build a regression model to predict the percentage of marks that students are likely to score based on the number of hours they study.
- **Key Concepts**: Regression Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation.

### 6. Stock Market Prediction (`Stock Market Prediction`)
- **Description**: This project involves predicting stock market prices using machine learning algorithms.
- **Key Concepts**: Time Series Analysis, Regression, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation.

### 7. Terrorist Analysis (`TerroristAnalysis.py`)
- **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing terrorist activities to uncover patterns and trends using various data analysis techniques.
- **Key Concepts**: Data Analysis, Visualization, Statistical Analysis.

## How to Run the Projects

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` or in each notebook)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KamelSenfro/Spark-Foundation-Intership-Projects/tree/main.git
    cd ml-projects
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

    Using `pip`:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Or manually install the libraries:

    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the desired notebook and run the cells:**

    Navigate to the respective `.ipynb` file (e.g., `DTclassifier.ipynb`) and run the cells to see the results.

### Running Python Scripts

For the `TerroristAnalysis.py` script, you can run it directly from the command line:

```sh
python TerroristAnalysis.py
